## 📌 **Overview**

The **Time Tracker Extension** helps me see how I spend my time in Visual Studio Code. It tracks and displays the time I spend on the following activities:

- **Typing:** Active coding time when I'm writing or editing code.
- **Idle:** Staying idle in the editor.
- **Building:** Time spent running build tasks.
- **Debugging:** Time spent debugging.

This extension keeps the information visible at all times, helping me stay mindful and demure.
